# Note
  - My intention behind creating this not to remove the human touch of wishing your loved ones on their birthday but its more for a organization/firm who wish to send automatic brithday greetings to employees or clients.
  - Other applications for this is it can send automatic notifications and wishes for special days like festivals etc.
  - I would like to dedicate this project to my friend Vamsi Gajjala who asked me for a simple application for wishing his clients on important days.
