# SendGreetings
This Project is built to Send Greetings via Gmail, WhatsApp and SMS to List of people automatically. I used Google Drive, Google Sheets and Google Code Script to Achieve it.

Step 1: Create a Google Form with Name, Date of Birth, Mobile Number and Email.
Step 2: Go to Responses and Attach a Google Sheet to store the responses.
Step 3: Open the Google Sheet and Go to Tools -> Script Editor.
Step 4: The Script Editor will be launched. Copy Paste the content of files in the Script Editor.
Step 5: Update the necessary files where ever needed. You can find what needs to be updated in each file in the description section of each file.
Step 6: Run the Script to check if everything works.
Step 7: Configure the Trigger for the Project to Run the Scripts automatically without manual intervention.
